#Architecture

In this project, I employed both server-rendered frontends using Express, HTML, and JavaScript, as well dynamic rendering via external frameworks. For the backend, a NoSQL MongoDB database was chosen due to its flexibility in handling different data structures and its ability to easily scale.

#Functionality

JSON is a data storage format used to connect the frontend and backend, and during the full stack development process, code is reused to optimize functionality and higher efficiency, also optimizing development time. This allows for fewer requests to and from the server.

#Testing

In a full-stack application, methods are related to web actions and are used to interact with server backends and test the backend functionality. These actions extend the user's functionality.

#Reflection

This course has helped me reach my professional goal by allowing me to learn concepts to more efficiently develop for the web. The skills I learned will help me market myself as a basic web developer with experience in handles, HTML, JSON, JS, NOSQL, and Express.
