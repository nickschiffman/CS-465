#Architecture

In this project, I employed both server-rendered frontends using Express, HTML, and JavaScript, as well as an approach with dynamic rendering via external frameworks. For the backend, a NoSQL MongoDB database was chosen due to its flexibility in handling diverse data structures and its ability to scale to accommodate potential growth.

#Functionality

JSON is a data storing format usually used to connect the frontend and backend, and during the full stack development process, code could be reused to optimize functionality and higher efficiency, also optimizing development time.

#Testing

In a full-stack application, methods are usually related to web actions and are used to interact with server backends and test the backend functionality.
